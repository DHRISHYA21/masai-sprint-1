      <div><b><u>Himura Kenshin</u></b> <br><br>
        Himura Kenshin, known as the legendary hitokiri of the Meiji Revolution, Himura Battosai (?????), is the main protagonist and titular character of the Rurouni Kenshin series. Kenshin has spent ten years traveling Japan as a rurouni in search of redemption, carrying a sakabato with the vow to never kill again. In 1878, he arrives in Tokyo and takes up residence at the Kamiya Dojo, where his vow is tested as he fights to keep the country's peace. <br><br>
        At the end of the Bakumatsu, he becomes a wandering swordsman, now wielding a sakabato (???, literally "reverse-blade sword")—a katana that has the cutting edge on the inwardly curved side of the sword, thus being nearly incapable of killing. Kenshin wanders the Japanese countryside offering protection and aid to those in need as atonement for the murders he once committed as an assassin. <br><br>When creating Kenshin, Watsuki designed him to be the physical opposite of Hiko Seijuro, a character that appears in his first one-shot manga, "Crescent Moon in the Warring States"; a character with the same name appears in Rurouni Kenshin as Kenshin's swordsmanship teacher. As a result, he was given a feminine appearance with long red hair as well as cross-shaped scar in his face. <br><br>
        Kenshin dresses simply, wearing a plain men's kimono of cheap, worn cloth with a white umanori hakama, zori and white tabi.
